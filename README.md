# ML-Project Bike demand prediction
A SYMPHONY OF INSIGHTS: PREDICTIVE MODELLING FOR BIKE RENTAL DEMANDS.   
This project aims to predict bike rental demand based on historical data, factoring in variables like temperature, humidity, windspeed, time of day, and seasonality. Data preprocessing steps, such as handling missing values and selecting relevant features, ensure the quality and accuracy of the input data. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) helps uncover valuable insights, revealing trends, correlations, and patterns that influence bike rental behavior.

We implemented machine learning algorithms, specifically Linear Regression and Random Forest, to develop predictive models. These models were trained on the cleaned data, and their performance was evaluated using key metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared. The Random Forest model, known for its robustness and accuracy in handling complex relationships within data, outperformed Linear Regression in predicting bike rental demand.

The findings from the project contribute to improving bike-sharing systems by providing actionable insights into demand forecasting and resource allocation. By accurately predicting bike demand, the system can optimize the distribution of bikes, enhance customer satisfaction, and ensure better management of resources. Furthermore, the project lays the foundation for more efficient urban mobility solutions, which could be expanded to other transportation services in the future.

This project exemplifies the potential of data-driven decision-making in urban planning and public transportation, offering valuable tools for optimizing infrastructure and service delivery.

Introduction:
 	The growing trend of urbanization has led to an increased demand for efficient and sustainable transportation solutions. Among these solutions, bike-sharing systems have emerged as a viable alternative to traditional transport methods. By providing easy access to bicycles, these systems not only alleviate traffic congestion but also promote a healthier lifestyle among urban dwellers.
 	Understanding the dynamics of bike rental demand is essential for the effective management of these systems. Predictive modelling offers a powerful approach to analysing historical data and identifying the factors that influence bike usage. This project seeks to create a predictive model for bike rentals, taking into account various variables such as weather conditions, time of day, and seasonal patterns.
 	Utilizing machine learning techniques, specifically Linear Regression and Random Forest algorithms, this project will analyse historical bike rental data to forecast demand accurately. The insights gained from this analysis will assist city planners and bike-sharing operators in optimizing their services, enhancing user satisfaction, and promoting the use of sustainable transportation options.
  
Objectives:	
The primary objectives of this project are as follows:
 	Understand Demand Drivers: This objective focuses on identifying and analysing the key factors that influence bike rental demand. Factors such as weather conditions, including temperature and humidity, seasonal variations, time of day, and special events will be explored. By understanding these drivers, we can gain insights into how they affect the number of bike rentals, which is crucial for effective planning and resource allocation.
 	Develop Predictive Models: The project aims to create and evaluate various machine learning models to accurately forecast bike rental counts. Specifically, Linear Regression and Random Forest models will be implemented to assess their predictive capabilities. This objective emphasizes the importance of selecting the right algorithms to ensure reliable predictions.
 	Assess Model Performance: A critical aspect of this project involves measuring the effectiveness of the predictive models. We will employ performance metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared Score to determine which model yields the best predictions. This objective underscores the need for robust evaluation techniques to validate the models.
 	Visualize Data Relationships: This objective highlights the use of visual tools to represent relationships between variables and the distribution of bike rentals. By utilizing correlation heatmaps, scatter plots, and boxplots, we can better understand how different factors interact and influence bike rental demand. Visualization will facilitate a clearer interpretation of the data and results.
 	Provide Recommendations: Based on the analysis and model results, the project will offer actionable insights and recommendations for bike-sharing operators. These recommendations will focus on optimizing fleet management and improving service availability during peak demand periods. This objective aims to translate data insights into practical strategies for enhancing operational efficiency.
 	Explore Limitations and Future Work: Finally, this project will discuss the limitations encountered during the analysis and modelling process. By acknowledging these limitations, we can provide suggestions for potential improvements or areas for future research in bike-sharing demand forecasting. This objective ensures that the study remains relevant and sets the stage for continued exploration in this field.
